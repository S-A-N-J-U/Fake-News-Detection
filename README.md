# Fake News Detection

This repository contains code for a fake news detection system. The system uses a dataset of fake and true news articles to train a machine learning model that can classify news articles as either fake or true.

## Installation

To run the code locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd fake-news-detection


3. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

The `main.py` file contains the main code for the fake news detection system. You can run it using the following command:

python main.py


This will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance. The trained model can then be used to classify new news articles as fake or true.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is available in the `data` directory. It consists of two CSV files: `fake.csv` and `true.csv`, containing fake and true news articles, respectively.

## Results

The accuracy of the trained model on the test set is 99.27%. This indicates that the model performs well in distinguishing between fake and true news articles.
